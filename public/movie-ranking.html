    <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
       <p>This movie is about hope, inner hope; a good thing which keeps our lives looking forward.</p>
        <h3>Coach Carter</h3>
        <p>Coach Carter is a tale of a coach who practically benched his all star team for not 
            performing academically. It brought out the importance of discipline, respect, teamwork, and humility.</p>
    <h3>Lean on Me</h3>
    <p>This film has always struck a chord with my inner-teacher. Young people are and will<br />
    continue to be the future and change in our world. Lean On Me shows how young people<br>
    can grow and succeed if they're given the opportunity and structure to do so. Now that my<br>
    daughter is starting school in a new environment, I find even more reason to focus on guiding,<br>
    and fostering her development.</p>
