<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>   My name is Joshua Jimenez, and I am an ESL teacher who recently transitioned into the field of web development. Originally
   from USA, I am currently living and working in South Korea.</p>

<p>   I have always been passionate about technology and the internet, and I am thrilled to have made the career switch to 
   web development. I have been studying various coding languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. With my
   knowledge of React, I can create responsive and interactive user interfaces that make websites more dynamic and engaging.</p>

<p>   In my free time, I enjoy fixing things around the house, learning about different cultures, traveling, and cooking. I am 
   always looking for new ways to challenge myself and broaden my horizons.</p>
  
<p>   Teaching English as a second language has been a passion of mine for many years, and I have enjoyed helping students 
   improve their language skills and achieve their goals. However, I wanted to explore a new field that combined my passions
   for technology and teaching, which led me to web development.</p>
  
<p>   Today, I'm proud to call myself a front-end developer who brings a unique perspective to my work. My background in education
   has taught me the value of clear communication, user-centered design, and accessibility, and I strive to incorporate these 
   principles into everything I create. And while I may have left the classroom behind, I still see myself as a teacher at heart,
   always seeking to share my knowledge and help others grow.</p>
